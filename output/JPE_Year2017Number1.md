# In the Shadow of a Giant: Medicare’s Influence on Private Physician Payments

**Paper Link:** https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/689772

**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.1086/689772

**Abstract:**
We analyze Medicare’s influence on private insurers’ payments for physicians’ services. Using a large administrative change in reimbursements for surgical versus medical care, we find that private prices follow Medicare’s lead. A $1.00 increase in Medicare’s fees increases corresponding private prices by $1.16. A second set of Medicare fee changes, which generates area-specific payment shocks, has a similar effect on private reimbursements. Medicare’s influence is strongest in areas with concentrated insurers and competitive physician markets, consistent with insurer-doctor bargaining. By echoing Medicare’s pricing changes, these payment spillovers amplify Medicare’s impact on specialty choice and other welfare-relevant aspects of physician practices.



# Stochastic Choice and Preferences for Randomization

**Paper Link:** https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/689774

**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.1086/689774

**Abstract:**
We conduct an experiment in which subjects face the same questions repeated multiple times, with repetitions of two types: (1) following the literature, the repetitions are distant from each other; (2) in a novel treatment, the repetitions are in a row, and subjects are told that the questions will be repeated. We find that a large majority of subjects exhibit stochastic choice in both cases. We discuss the implications for models of stochastic choice.



# Unbalanced Random Matching Markets: The Stark Effect of Competition


**PDF Link:** https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/epdf/10.1086/689869

**Paper Link:** https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/689869

**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.1086/689869

**Abstract:**
We study competition in matching markets with random heterogeneous preferences and an unequal number of agents on either side. First, we show that even the slightest imbalance yields an essentially unique stable matching. Second, we give a tight description of stable outcomes, showing that matching markets are extremely competitive. Each agent on the short side of the market is matched with one of his top choices, and each agent on the long side either is unmatched or does almost no better than being matched with a random partner. Our results suggest that any matching market is likely to have a small core, explaining why small cores are empirically ubiquitous.



# Chinese College Admissions and School Choice Reforms: A Theoretical Analysis

**Paper Link:** https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/689773

**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.1086/689773

**Abstract:**
Each year approximately 10 million high school seniors in China compete for 6 million seats through a centralized college admissions system. Within the last decade, many provinces have transitioned from a “sequential” to a “parallel” mechanism to make their admissions decisions. In this study, we characterize a parametric family of application-rejection assignment mechanisms, including the sequential, deferred acceptance, and parallel mechanisms in a nested framework. We show that all of the provinces that have abandoned the sequential mechanism have moved toward less manipulable and more stable mechanisms. We also show that existing empirical evidence is consistent with our theoretical predictions.



# The Macroeconomic Effects of Housing Wealth, Housing Finance, and Limited Risk Sharing in General Equilibrium


**PDF Link:** https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/epdf/10.1086/689606

**Paper Link:** https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/689606

**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.1086/689606

**Abstract:**
This paper studies a quantitative general equilibrium model of housing. The model has two key elements not previously considered in existing quantitative macro studies of housing finance: aggregate business cycle risk and a realistic wealth distribution driven in the model by bequest heterogeneity in preferences. These features of the model play a crucial role in the following results. First, a relaxation of financing constraints leads to a large boom in house prices. Second, the boom in house prices is entirely the result of a decline in the housing risk premium. Third, low interest rates cannot explain high home values.



# Matching, Sorting, and the Distributional Effects of International Trade


**PDF Link:** https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/epdf/10.1086/689608

**Paper Link:** https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/689608

**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.1086/689608

**Abstract:**
We study the distributional consequences of trade in a world with two industries and two heterogeneous factors of production. Productivity in each production unit reflects the ability of the manager and the abilities of the workers, with complementarity between the two. We begin by examining the forces that govern the sorting of worker and manager types to industries and the matching of workers and managers within industries. We then consider how changes in relative output prices generated by changes in the trading environment affect sorting, matching, and the distributions of wages and salaries.



# Nonlinear Effects of Taxation on Growth


**PDF Link:** https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/epdf/10.1086/689607

**Paper Link:** https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/689607

**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.1086/689607

**Abstract:**
We propose a model consistent with two observations. First, the tax rates adopted by different countries are generally uncorrelated with their growth performance. Second, countries that drastically reduce private incentives to invest severely hurt their growth performance. In our model, the effects of taxation on growth are highly nonlinear. Low tax rates have a very small impact on long-run growth rates. But as tax rates rise, their negative impact on growth rises dramatically. The median voter chooses tax rates that have a small impact on growth prospects, making the relation between tax rates and economic growth difficult to measure empirically.
