# Optimal Taxation and Human Capital Policies over the Life Cycle


**PDF Link:** https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/epdf/10.1086/694291

**Paper Link:** https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/694291

**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.1086/694291

**Abstract:**
This paper derives optimal income tax and human capital policies in a life cycle model with risky human capital. The government faces asymmetric information regarding agents’ ability, its evolution, and labor supply. When the wage elasticity with respect to ability is increasing in human capital, the optimal subsidy involves less than full deductibility of human capital expenses on the tax base and falls with age. Income-contingent loans or a deferred deductibility scheme can implement the optimum. Numerical results suggest that full deductibility of expenses is close to optimal and that simple linear age-dependent policies perform very well.



# The Design of Debt-Clearing Markets: Clearinghouse Mechanisms in Preindustrial Europe


**PDF Link:** https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/epdf/10.1086/694288

**Paper Link:** https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/694288

**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.1086/694288

**Abstract:**
We examine the evolution of the decentralized clearinghouse mechanisms that were in use throughout Europe from the thirteenth century to the eighteenth century; in particular, we explore the clearing of nontradable or limited-tradable debts such as bills of exchange. We construct a theoretical model of these clearinghouse mechanisms and show that the specific decentralized multilateral clearing algorithms known asrescontre,skontrieren, orvirement des parties, used by merchants in this period, were efficient in specific historical contexts. Our analysis contributes to the understanding of these mechanisms during late medieval and early modern fairs and their robustness during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.



# Uncertainty Shocks and Balance Sheet Recessions


**PDF Link:** https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/epdf/10.1086/694290

**Paper Link:** https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/694290

**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.1086/694290

**Abstract:**
This paper investigates the origin and propagation of balance sheet recessions. I first show that in standard models driven by TFP shocks, the balance sheet channel disappears when agents can write contracts on the aggregate state of the economy. Optimal contracts sever the link between leverage and aggregate risk sharing, eliminating the concentration of aggregate risk that drives balance sheet recessions. I then show that uncertainty shocks can help explain this concentration of aggregate risk and drive balance sheet recessions, even with contracts on aggregate shocks. The mechanism is quantitatively important, and I explore implications for financial regulation.



# Financial Constraints and Moral Hazard: The Case of Franchising


**PDF Link:** https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/epdf/10.1086/694566

**Paper Link:** https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/694566

**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.1086/694566

**Abstract:**
Financial constraints are considered an important impediment to growth for small businesses. We study theoretically and empirically the relationship between the financial constraints of agents and the organizational decisions and growth of principals, in the context of franchising. We find that a 30 percent decrease in average collateralizable housing wealth in an area is associated with a delay in chains’ entry into franchising by 0.33 year on average, or 10 percent of the average waiting time, and a reduction in chain growth and hence a reduction in franchised chain employment of about 9 percent.



# Macroprudential Policy, Countercyclical Bank Capital Buffers, and Credit Supply: Evidence from the Spanish Dynamic Provisioning Experiments


**PDF Link:** https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/epdf/10.1086/694289

**Paper Link:** https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/694289

**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.1086/694289

**Abstract:**
To study the impact of macroprudential policy on credit supply cycles and real effects, we analyze dynamic provisioning. Introduced in Spain in 2000, revised four times, and tested in its countercyclicality during the crisis, it affected banks differentially. We find that dynamic provisioning smooths credit supply cycles and, in bad times, supports firm performance. A 1 percentage point increase in capital buffers extends credit to firms by 9 percentage points, increasing firm employment (6 percentage points) and survival (1 percentage point). Moreover, there are important compositional effects in credit supply related to risk and regulatory arbitrage by nonregulated and regulated but less affected banks.



# The Power of Abortion Policy: Reexamining the Effects of Young Women’s Access to Reproductive Control


**PDF Link:** https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/epdf/10.1086/694293

**Paper Link:** https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/694293

**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.1086/694293

**Abstract:**
I provide new evidence on the relative “powers” of contraception and abortion policy in effecting the dramatic social transformations of the 1960s and 1970s. Trends in sexual behavior suggest that young women’s increased access to the birth control pill fueled the sexual revolution, but neither these trends nor difference-in-difference estimates support the view that this also led to substantial changes in family formation. Rather, the estimates robustly suggest that it was liberalized access to abortion that allowed large numbers of women to delay marriage and motherhood.
